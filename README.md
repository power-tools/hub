# PowerTools / Hub

PowerTools are best described on the GitHub Page but the goal is to create utilities that can be hosted in any Dynamics 365 Instance and aide customizers and configurers in modifying the system in the new PowerApps world.  As enhancements, new solutions, and components materialize look for new folders and new versions of the solution here.

## Installing

For the latest stable version:
```bash
Import PowerTools_0_2_0_0.zip into your Dynamics 365 CE Instance
```

To start building your own PowerTools try out our flavor of create react app (after reading through the wiki and learning about the underlying structure):
```bash
$ yarn create react-app my-new-pt --scripts-version pt-react-scripts --typescript
```

To add commonly used components to your Power Tools Solution:
```bash
$ yarn add pt-components
```

You can also visit the discord channel and ask questions along your learning/building path: <https://discord.gg/HvkM6dG> . I have it on my phone and monitor it regularly.
