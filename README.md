# PowerTools / Hub

PowerTools are best described on the GitHub Page but the goal is to create utilities that can be hosted in any Dynamics 365 Instance and aide customizers and configurers in modifying the system in the new PowerApps world.  As enhancements and new solutions materialize look for new folders and new versions of the solution here.

## Installing

For the latest stable version:
```bash
Import PowerTools_0_0_2_0.zip into your Dynamics 365 CE Instance
```
